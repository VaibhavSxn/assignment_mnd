## Task Description

Develop a system that rates each journalist based on how well they match each newsroom. Your solution should:

- Create a scoring mechanism that evaluates the relevance of each journalist to a newsroom.
- Develop a ranking system that presents the most suitable journalists to the user based on the scores.

The goal is to enable users to easily identify and select journalists who are the best fit for specific newsrooms.

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - Code (in the language of your choice) implementing your solution or at least showing your intended solution
2. **README Documentation**
   - Instructions on how to set up and run your code.
   - Overview of your approach and methodologies.
3. **Sample Output**
   - A ranked list of journalists with their corresponding relevance scores, for one or more newsrooms (possibly with motivations)
